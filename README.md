# Wearables E-Commerce Project

Full-Stack Group Project completed in less than 5 days.

With the help of my teammates, we were able to create an impressive e-commerce website, that offers a variety of wearable tech products for users to choose from.
To develop this website, we used the MERN stack, which stands for "MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js".

The data has been provided by our instructors, we had to plan and develop the rest.
For planning the structure and the design, we used Figma. 
As a complete beginner, I was very impressed by how quickly we got the structure done by following the plan built on Figma.
